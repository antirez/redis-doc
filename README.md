# Redis documentation

## Clients

All clients are listed in the `clients.json` file.
Each key in the JSON object represents a single client library.
For example:

```
"Rediska": {

  # A programming language should be specified.
  "language": "PHP",

  # If the project has a website of its own, put it here.
  # Otherwise, lose the "url" key.
  "url": "http://rediska.geometria-lab.net",

  # A URL pointing to the repository where users can
  # find the code.
  "repository": "http://github.com/Shumkov/Rediska",

  # A short, free-text description of the client.
  # Should be objective. The goal is to help users
  # choose the correct client they need.
  "description": "A PHP client",

  # An array of Twitter usernames for the authors
  # and maintainers of the library.
  "authors": ["shumkov"]

}
```

## Commands

Redis commands are described in the `commands.json` file.

For each command there's a Markdown file with a complete, human-readable
description.
We process this Markdown to provide a better experience, so some things to take
into account:

*   Inside text, all commands should be written in all caps, in between
    backticks.
    For example: `INCR`.

*   You can use some magic keywords to name common elements in Redis.
    For example: `@multi-bulk-reply`.
    These keywords will get expanded and auto-linked to relevant parts of the
    documentation.

There should be at least two predefined sections: description and return value.
The return value section is marked using the @return keyword:

```
Returns all keys matching the given pattern.

@return

@multi-bulk-reply: all the keys that matched the pattern.
```

## Styling guidelines

Please use the following formatting rules:

* Wrap lines to 80 characters.
* Start every sentence on a new line.

Luckily, this repository comes with an automated Markdown formatter.
To only reformat the files you have modified, first stage them using `git add`
(this makes sure that your changes won't be lost in case of an error), then run
the formatter:

```
$ rake format:cached
```

The formatter has the following dependencies:

* Redcarpet
* Nokogiri
* The `par` tool

Installation of the Ruby gems:

```
gem install redcarpet nokogiri
```

Installation of par (OSX):

```
brew install par
```

Installation of par (Ubuntu):

```
sudo apt-get install par
```

## Checking your work

Once you're done, the very least you should do is make sure that all files
compile properly.
You can do this by running Rake inside your working directory.

```
$ rake parse
```

Note that `parse` depends on the following gems:

* `json`
* `batch`
* `rdiscount`

Additionally, if you have [Aspell][han] installed, you can spell check the
documentation:

[han]: http://aspell.net/

```
$ rake spellcheck
```

Exceptions can be added to `./wordlist`.
