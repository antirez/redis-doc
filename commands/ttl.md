Returns the remaining time to live of a key that has a timeout.
This introspection capability allows a Redis client to check how many seconds a
given key will continue to be part of the dataset.

@return

@integer-reply: TTL in seconds, `-2` when `key` does not exist or `-1` when `key` does not
have a timeout.

@examples

```cli
SET mykey "Hello"
EXPIRE mykey 10
TTL mykey
```
