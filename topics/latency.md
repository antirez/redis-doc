Redis latency problems troubleshooting
===

This document will help you understanding what the problem could be if you
are experiencing latency problems with Redis.

In this context *latency* is the maximum delay between the time a client
issues a command and the time the reply to the command is received by the
client. Usually Redis processing time is extremely low, in the sub microsecond
range, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.

Latency induced by network and communication
--------------------------------------------

Clients connect to Redis using a TCP/IP connection or a Unix domain connection.
The typical latency of a 1 GBits/s network is about 200 us, while the latency
with a Unix domain socket can be as low as 30 us. It actually depends on your
network and system hardware. On top of the communication itself, the system
adds some more latency (due to thread scheduling, CPU caches, NUMA placement,
etc ...). System induced latencies are significantly higher on a virtualized
environment than on a physical machine.

The consequence is even if Redis processes most commands in sub microsecond
range, a client performing many roundtrips to the server will have to pay
for these network and system related latencies.

An efficient client will therefore try to limit the number of roundtrips by
pipelining several commands together. This is fully supported by the servers
and most clients. Aggregated commands like MSET/MGET can be also used for
that purpose. Starting with Redis 2.4, a number of commands also support
variadic parameters for all data types.

Here are some guidelines:

+ If you can afford it, prefer a physical machine over a VM to host the server.
+ Do not systematically connect/disconnect to the server (especially true
  for web based applications). Keep your connections as long lived as possible.
+ If your client is on the same host than the server, use Unix domain sockets.
+ Prefer to use aggregated commands (MSET/MGET), or commands with variadic
  parameters (if possible) over pipelining.
+ Prefer to use pipelining (if possible) over sequence of roundtrips.
+ Future version of Redis will support Lua server-side scripting
  (experimental branches are already available) to cover cases that are not
  suitable for raw pipelining (for instance when the result of a command is
  an input for the following commands).

On Linux, some people can achieve better latencies by playing with process
placement (taskset), cgroups, real-time priorities (chrt), NUMA
configuration (numactl), or by using a low-latency kernel. Please note
vanilla Redis is not really suitable to be bound on a **single** CPU core.
Redis can fork background tasks that can be extremely CPU consuming
like bgsave or AOF rewrite. These tasks must **never** run on the same core
as the main event loop.

In most situations, these kind of system level optimizations are not needed.
Only do them if you require them, and if you are familiar with them.

Single threaded nature of Redis
-------------------------------

Redis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process
serves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.
This means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so
all the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how node.js
works as well. However you usually don't feel at all Redis or Node are slow
since the time to serve a single request is very small, and this kind of
programs are designed to do not block on system calls, for instance to read
new data from sockets.

I said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4
we use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the
background, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact
that Redis servers all the requests using a single thread.

Latency generated by slow commands
----------------------------------

A consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve
all the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing
normal commands, like **GET** or **SET** or **LPUSH** this is not a problem
at all since this commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.
However there are commands operating on many elements, like **SORT**, **LREM**,
**SUNION** and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets
can take a considerable amount of time.

The algorithmic complexity of all commands is documented. A good practice
is to systematically check it when using commands you are not familiar with.

If you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against
values composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis
replication where to run all your slow queries.

It is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis
[Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).

Additionally, you can use your favorite per-process monitoring program
(top, htop, prstat, etc ...) to quickly check the CPU consumption of the
main Redis process. If it is high while the traffic is not, it is usually
a sign that slow commands are used.


Latency generated by fork
-------------------------

Depending on the chosen persistency mechanism, Redis has to fork background
processes. The fork operation (running in the main thread) can induce latency
by itself.

Forking is an expensive operation on most Unix-like systems, since it involves
copying a good number of objects linked to the process. This is especially
true for the page table associated to the virtual memory mechanism.

For instance on a Linux/AMD64 system, the memory is divided in 4 KB pages.
To convert virtual addresses to physical addresses, each process stores
a page table (actually represented as a tree) containing at least a pointer
per page of the address space of the process. So a large 24 GB Redis instance
requires a page table of 24 GB / 4 KB * 8 = 48 MB.

When a background save is performed, this instance will have to be forked,
which will involve allocating and copying 48 MB of memory. It takes time
and CPU, especially on virtual machines where allocation and initialization
of a large memory chunk can be expensive.

Some CPUs can use different page size though. AMD and Intel CPUs can support
2 MB page size if needed. These pages are nicknamed *huge pages*. Some
operating systems can optimize page size in real time, transparently
aggregating small pages into huge pages on the fly.

On Linux, explicit huge pages management has been introduced in 2.6.16, and
implicit transparent huge pages are available starting in 2.6.38. If you
run recent Linux distributions (for example RH 6 or derivatives), transparent
huge pages can be activated, and you can use a vanilla Redis version with them.

This is the preferred way to experiment/use with huge pages on Linux.

Now, if you run older distributions (RH 5, SLES 10-11, or derivatives), and
not afraid of a few hacks, Redis requires to be patched in order to support
huge pages.

The first step would be to read Mel Gorman's primer on huge pages.
http://lwn.net/Articles/374424/

There are currently two ways to patch Redis to support huge pages.

+ For Redis 2.4, the embedded jemalloc allocator must be patched.
https://gist.github.com/1171054 by Pieter Noordhuis. Note this patch relies
on the anonymous mmap huge page support, only available starting 2.6.32,
so this method cannot be used for older distributions (RH 5, SLES 10,
and derivatives).

+ For Redis 2.2, or 2.4 with the libc allocator, Redis makefile
must be altered to link Redis with the libhugetlbfs library
whose source code is available at
http://libhugetlbfs.sourceforge.net/
It is a straightforward change.

Then, the system must be configured to support huge pages.

The following command allocates and makes N huge pages available:

    $ sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=<N>

The following command mounts the huge page filesystem:

    $ sudo mount -t hugetlbfs none /mnt/hugetlbfs

In all cases, once Redis is running with huge pages (transparent or
not), the following benefits are expected:

+ The latency due to the fork operations is dramatically reduced.
  This is mostly useful for very large instances, and especially
  on a VM.
+ Redis is faster due to the fact the translation look-aside buffer
  (TLB) of the CPU is more efficient to cache page table entries
  (i.e. the hit ratio is better). Do not expect miracle, it is only
  a few percent gain at most.
+ Redis memory cannot be swapped out anymore, which is interesting
  to avoid outstanding latencies due to virtual memory.

Unfortunately, and on top of the extra operational complexity,
there is also a significant drawback of running Redis with
huge pages. The COW mechanism granularity is the page. With
2 MB pages, the probability a page is modified during a background
save operation is 512 times higher than with 4 KB pages. The actual
memory required for a background save therefore increases a lot,
especially if the write traffic is truly random, with poor locality.
With huge pages, using twice the memory while saving is not anymore
a theoretical incident. It may really happen.

Latency due to AOF and disk I/O
-------------------------------

Another source of latency is due to the Append Only File support on Redis.
The AOF basically uses two system calls to accomplish its work. One is
write(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and
the other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel
file buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by
the user.

Both the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.
For instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync
in progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires
to flush on disk in order to accept new writes.

The fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations
of kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to
a few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process
doing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call
in a different thread since Redis 2.4.

We'll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency
when using the AOF file.

The AOF can be configured to perform an fsync on disk in three different
ways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be
modified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).

* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.
In this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).
When this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can't
cope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is
uncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing
I/O.

* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs an
fsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still
in progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds
(since write would block on Linux if an fsync is in progress against the
same file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually
perform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this
can be a source of latency.

* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** an fsync is performed
at every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code
(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time
into a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and
it is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation
that can perform the fsync in short time.

Most Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the
appendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is
to avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.
Using an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform
well with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes
to the append only file without performing any seek.

If you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only
file you can use the strace command under Linux:

    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync

The above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by
Redis in the main thread. With the above command you'll not see the
fdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the
the appendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so
just add the -f switch to strace.

If you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the
following command:

    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write

However since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client
sockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.
Apparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so
I use the following command:

    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v '0.0' | grep -v unfinished
