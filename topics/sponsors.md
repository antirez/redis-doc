Redis Sponsors
===

Starting from May 2013, all the work [Salvatore Sanfilippo](http://twitter.com/antirez) is doing in order to develop Redis is sponsored by [Pivotal](http://gopivotal.com). The Redis project no longer accepts money donations.

Before May 2013 the project was sponsored by VMware with the work of [Salvatore Sanfilippo](http://twitter.com/antirez) and [Pieter Noordhuis](http://twitter.com/pnoordhuis).

In the past Redis accepted donations from the following companies:

* [Linode](http://linode.com) 15 January 2010, provided Virtual Machines for Redis testing in a virtualized environment.
* [Slicehost](http://slicehost.com) 14 January 2010, provided Virtual Machines for Redis testing in a virtualized environment.
* [Citrusbyte](http://citrusbyte.com) 18 Dec 2009, part of Virtual Memory. Citrusbyte is also the company developing the Redis-rb bindings for Redis and this very web site.
* [Hitmeister](http://www.hitmeister.de/) 15 Dec 2009, part of Redis Cluster.
* [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com) 13 Dec 2009, for blocking POP (BLPOP) and part of the Virtual Memory implementation.

Also thanks to the following people or organizations that donated to the Project:

We are grateful to [Pivotal](http://gopivotal.com), [VMware](http://vmware.com) and to the other companies and people that donated to the Redis project. Thank you.

## redis.io

[Citrusbyte](https://citrusbyte.com) sponsored the creation of the official
Redis logo (designed by [Carlos Prioglio](http://carlosprioglio.com)) and
transferred its copyright to Salvatore Sanfilippo.

They also sponsored the initial implementation of this site by
[Damian Janowski](https://twitter.com/djanowski) and [Michel
Martens](https://twitter.com/soveran). Damian and Michel remain the current
maintainers.

The `redis.io` domain is kindly donated to the project by [I Want My
Name](https://iwantmyname.com).
